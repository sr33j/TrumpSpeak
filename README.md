# TrumpSpeak

Say what you're thinking and we'll translate it into Trump Speak!

1) Get word vectors (Word2Vec) from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit
2) You need to download Trump's tweets by running "python downloadTweets.py". This will save the tweet vectors in a numpy file.
3) You are now ready to run the flask app with "python TrumpServer.py"
